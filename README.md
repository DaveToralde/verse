**Ryben Verse** can be used in live productions where a bible verse needs to be presented in **full screen**, 
or for personal bible verse reading.
The **responsive** text auto-resizes based on window size and text length.

# Verse Title & Version UI controls
Changing the verse or translation in these controls does not sync with the other tabs of the browser.
These intuitive controls also allow for multiple open browser tabs having different verses/translations displayed.
